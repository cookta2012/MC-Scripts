# MC-Scripts
A source for mod integration scripts for anyone to use


The goal of this project is to make a repository in which a large set of minetweaker or configuration files can be stored by multiple authors.  

To add your own scripts, make a pull request.  It is suggested that scripts go under \username.  Pull request should be expedited because other than file structure, there's no real content requirement.
